## Project Introduction and Practical Application
This semester, we will be attempting to build a neural network from scratch that will verify the authenticity of a handwritten signature. This project is actually quite applicable to the real world, most prominently with things like the mobile deposit of checks. The ease of depositing a check from your couch is amazing from the consumerâ€™s perspective, but catching fraudulent checks still remains challenging for the banks. Another application is in the ever-so popular sports memorabilia industry. Validating and checking the signatures of the most famous athletes in the world is a profession that evaluates pieces of history worth millions of dollars, and an AI system can only help this industry even more. Forgery has always been a problem, and a neural network may be a nice solution to detecting this type of fraud.
